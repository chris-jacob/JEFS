-- Description:  Checks if there is an active Stop or an active Recovery
-- If there is a stop, the Job is stopped
-- If there is no stop but a recovery and @StopRecoveryID = 0 (=>the current Job is not executed as Part of a recovery),
--		the Job is Stopped
--
-- StopMode: 1: Entire Job is skipped, SP is called at MasterPackage Start
--			 2: Job was started, and Stop detected later
