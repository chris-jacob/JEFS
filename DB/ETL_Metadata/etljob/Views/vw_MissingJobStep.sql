-- Author:		 (Ceteris AG; Christoph Seck, "CS")
-- Create date: 2014-07-16
-- Description: Detect missing Standard Job Steps
-- Changed 2015-02-24; CS: Added Use View vw_Folder2Job for further configuration options
-- Changed 2015-03-05; CS: Added ProjectID in Folder2Job -> Per F2J.JobID:
--						   If ProjectID is Empty in F2J and for Folder no Other line (with not Null ProjectID) Just link by Folder ID
--						   If ProjectID is Not Null, ignore possible line with ProjectID Null
--						   Handled by FilterMustBeOne
-- Changed 2015-03-09; CS: Added IsFrozen and PackageMask in Folder2Job and MaxNoOfJobs in [etljob].[Package]
--							If IsFrozen = 1 then only Packages not in JobStep at all will be shown
--							If MaxNoOfJobs <> 0 and at least MaxNoOfJobs Jobs contain Package the package will not be shown
--							If PackageMask is not NULL, it filters Packages
-- Changed 2015-09-01; CS: Bug with IsFrozenHandling (dubble "NOT" removed)
-- Hint: in the F2J table Folder + Project + Job are unique -> different configurations are possible (for different jobs)
